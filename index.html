<p>💡As the analysis shows, all members in the Simpson family are very central characters in terms of both betweenness and closeness with the most central person being Homer Simpson in both measures. This is not surprising since the show is called &ldquo;The Simpsons&rdquo;.</p>

  <h3 id="community-analysis">Community Analysis</h3>
</div>
<h4 id="guess-how-many-communities-in-simpson-universe">💭Guess How many communities in Simpson Universe?</h4>
<p>💡Anyway, we find 12 communities in the network through the Louvain algorithm.</p>
<p>Check the graph of simpson communities below.
<img src="/community_network.png" alt="demo" class="img-responsive"></p>
<p>Continue with the word cloud picture for each community based on text from wiki page.
<img src="/community_wordclouds.png" alt="demo" class="img-responsive"></p>
<p>💡The figures above shows the most common words based on the TF-IDF as word clouds for each of the communities. Some of them are quite meaningful whereas some of them looks to be very similar. E.g. wordcloud (2,2), (3,1) and (1,3) seems to be very school related. And thus have mentions like school, Skinner (principal), Nelson (bully) and horror (I think we all could relate back in elementary school). Moreover, we have the wordclouds (4,1), (3,2) and (2,3) which all seems to represent the old people since it contains words like deceased, family, Abe (Homer&rsquo;s dad) herb (natural medicine?), and law (apperantly the law is important for the old people?).</p>

<img src="/child-adults-seniors_wordcloud.png" alt="demo" class="img-responsive">
<p>💡As seen above, there are some differences between the most common words used for children, adults and seniors. Children are focused on school, class and friends, which are quite innoncent things. Then the adults talk about time (perhaps always in hurry?), horror (bills and work maybe?), job, and game. Lastly, the seniors are associated with the words great, law, deceased, family mr and file. Maybe the seniors like to be called with their pronoun, that maybe explains mr? The elderly maybe also focuses more on their family since they have nothing else to do? Overall, it seems that the differenes in the different life stages in the Simpsons very well translates to the real life where we the situtation is very similar.

<h4 id="check-some-differences-between-men-and-women-in-the-simpsons">💭Check some differences between men and women in The Simpsons</h4>
<img src="/gender_wordclouds.png" alt="demo" class="img-responsive">
<p>💡There seem to be no clear differences between men and women. Maybe the women are more associated with their hair and the school of their children, whereas the men tend to work more and be more focused on the time? If one has watched the series, then you would maybe have noticed that you mostly see the men working, which may explain these wordclouds.

<p>📝 It seems that the network is grouped by how &ldquo;popular&rdquo; the characters are.

<p>😕 The wordclouds doesn&rsquo;t give us a lot of information and any new insight to the many different subgroups in the Simpsons universe. Stiil need future work on the TF-IDF measure implemention.</p>
